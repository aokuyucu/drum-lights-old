This repository contains several sketches for different hardware using different libraries.
The latest and greatest is wemos_piezo_NeoPixel.
    As the name imples, it is written for use with Wemos D1, a piezo trigger and the NeoPixel library.
    It has a startup sequence and multiple colors.
    This code was written for 5 basses, each with a different colors and contains constants to make switching colors easy.
